/**
 * This is a recommended comment format for all your JAVA applications.
 * Here you can indicate the description of the class or method. In this case we only have one class.
 *
 * This JAVA application allows you to print the text: <Hello World> through the console right after its execution.
 *
 * Remember, as we are getting started, in order to run this code you need to open a command console instance.
 * Place the prompt of this instance in the directory of this file.java and execute the [javac helloworld.java] command to compile it.
 * Then execute the [java helloworld] command. This last command will be responsible for running our application (helloworld.class).
 *
 * Note: in order to execute the command [javac ...] it is necessary to have previously installed
 * the java developer kit that best suits us from the official java website.
 *
 * You can use tags such as @param, @return, and @throws to document the parameters, return value, and exceptions thrown by a method.
 *
 * @param parameter Parameter description
 * @return Return value description
 * @throws ExceptionType Description of the exception thrown
 *
 * In this case we haven't additional methods in the main program, no return data or useful parameters to transfer to our program.
